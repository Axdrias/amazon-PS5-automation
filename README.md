# Amazon Purchase Script 

**Use at your own risk. Read thoroughly**

Example: script to buy a PS5 on Amazon (Please do not use this script for scalping, this is simply a free open source solution for those that want a console but are unable to get one due to market competitiveness)

forked from yosh1/amazon-automation

Updates: 
--- 
  * Solves for CAPTCHA

Requirements: 
--- 
* Python 3 
* Python modules in `requirements.txt` 
* [WebDriver for Chrome](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) in same directory 

Recommended to be run on Linux or Max. Would be a good script to run on a raspberry pi or server

Notes of caution: 
--- 

Things to check for on Amazon/potential edge cases: 

 * Amazon 2FA (an option is to disable but this will **expose your account to security problems**)
 * ~~Currently uses 1 click buy. Confirm your default address + payments is correct before running this script~~
 * 1 Click buy sometimes did not work for me, so I used the "Add to cart method". I left the 1-click-buy-method in if you want to use that instead.
 * Captchas for hitting Amazon's server a lot

## Logic/Behavior: 
 
 1. Starts Selenium 
 2. Loops the following until all attributes of the item are correct: 
    1. Verifies item is in stock 
    2. Verifies the price is less than the set maximum
    3. Checks to make sure the shipper is from Amazon.com 
        
        *NOTE: I used shipper instead of seller because quite a few items are not actually sold by Amazon.* **Change this on a case by case basis**
4. Logs in 
5. Adds to cart 
6. Checks out
